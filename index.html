            <p style="font-size: 2.5vh;">Menstruation, or getting period, is a normal and healthy part of life for most women. However, it’s still stigmatized in many places. Some girls and women feel embarrassed or ashamed when they have to address their periods. It can even cause some people to avoid certain activities and miss out on important experiences. That’s why menstruation awareness and events like National Period Day on 10 October and Menstrual hygiene Day on 28 May are so important.</p>
